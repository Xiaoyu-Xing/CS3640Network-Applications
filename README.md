## network tools
This is a collection of usefull tools extracted from one of my course in network. 
It contains: 
1. sniff/craft packets and implement traceroute by Scapy, 
2. emulate network by Mininet and measure performance, 
3. anyalyze BGP route, build routing tables and detect GBP hijack, 
4. crawl web pages/parse HAR data
